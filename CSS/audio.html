This was a great moment in history for celtics basketball. Paul Pierce hit the game winning 3 pointer over Lebron James, who had decided to join the Miami Heat and in turn make the NBA non competitive. This wasn't just a great moment for Celtics fans but for fans of Basketball in general who were foaming at the mouth to watch Lebron lose.  </p>
